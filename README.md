Based on the detailed technical specifications in your project synopsis, here is a refined and professional version of **Option 2** for your GitHub repository description.

### **Car Body Type Classifier (Using CNN)**

This project is an end-to-end deep learning system designed to automatically classify vehicle images into specific categories: **Sedan, SUV, and Hatchback**. Developed using **Python** and **TensorFlow/Keras**, it leverages a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to automate vehicle identification, which is highly useful for automotive sales platforms, insurance automation, and autonomous driving systems.

### **Key Technical Features**

* 
**Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes a sequential CNN architecture with multiple convolutional and pooling layers for hierarchical feature extraction from car images.


* 
**Data Pipeline & Augmentation**: Employs an `ImageDataGenerator` for real-time data augmentation (rotation, flipping, zooming) to ensure model robustness against varying angles and lighting conditions.


* 
**High Performance**: Achieves a validation accuracy of over **98%** using the **Adam optimizer** and **categorical cross-entropy loss**.


* 
**Interactive Predictions**: Features a real-time prediction module that provides both the predicted class and the model's confidence percentage for any user-uploaded car image.


* 
**Comprehensive Evaluation**: Includes performance tracking via confusion matrices, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure high-reliability classification.
